# Problem-solving and Competitive Programming

This repository contains solutions of some of the problems I have solved on different platforms across the web majorly
Codechef, Codeforces. 

**Currently, I am in the process of updating this repository and making major changes.**
 
 
 - [ ] Write better code for future problems, try to analyse(like I do for LC/IB). Maintain copies of code with explanation and proper names like I did for the IP repo. Maintain explanations for future reference. Helps for revision and someone else might refer. Think for longer, take inspiration from MathProgrammer, Mandilya 
 - [ ] Write standard implementations of slighly advanced stuff and maintain copy here. 
 - [ ] Scrape HackerRank solutions and learn to scrape other solutions from the scripts available on github.
 - [ ] Become active in sometime in solving CP style problems. 
 - [ ] Decide on splitting into subfolders in future.
 - [ ] Participate more in AtCoder contests. Check out the new tools about CF.
 - [ ] Add your thoughts and reflections on CP. Write about the ideas shared in the 3rd sem Data Structures repository.
 - [ ] Use this as primary repo to commit solutions.
 - [ ] Add standard implementations from the other repo here. Filter out them from codes in this repository also.
 - [ ] Add some favourite resources.
