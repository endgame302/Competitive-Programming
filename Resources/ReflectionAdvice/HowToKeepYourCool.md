How can you keep your cool?
The simplest way is to take a minute break and approach the problem from a completely different point of view. It's okay to mess up. It's okay to have such many WAs. Just keep trying. In the end, this is a part of learning as well.

Sometimes, some things just don't strike us. For example, not remembering some rarely used algorithm. It's okay. Just give some time.

Take a break.
Read the problem statement as if you are reading it for the first time.
Jot down all the points and conditions in the problem statement.
Think again and do not let your old solution come in the way.
