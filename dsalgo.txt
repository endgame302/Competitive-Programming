Dynamic programming 
 a) kadane algorithm


21st sept 2019
After completion of this : algo course to be continued soon,
Complete data structures course this semester itself and write all the stuff.

Future  : After completing algorithms and maybe ds course on coursera
AVL tree and B-trees, learn by independently. No course needed.
Consider unordered data structures course and C++ for c programmers part a and part b in future.

IMPORTANT : 
	 I will become a top dsa guy. For that, I will complete or atleast do the first five courses of the 
	Data Structures and Algorithms specialization.
Make Sure that you spend proper time with the algorithms. Learn them by understanding, implementing and 
then try to remember. Try to recall in mind. Think about them. Practice questions related to the topics learnt.
Spend time. Mind-map and think about modifying. Before going onto other resources, spend time and try to think 
about what they have taught.
